	<p>29th of Feb was awful. I went to a local bar and turned down a couple of beer's, and headed to meet a client. Shortly after I concluded the business, I was heading home and parked in a neighborhood bar. I gulped 3 large pegs of rum. As I was prepared to leave, I discovered that my credit card did not operate. I did not have money. Nor I had an appropriate balance on my debit card. Thus, I summoned a buddy to meet my bill. Right at this moment, I was agitated, disgusted, and felt emotionally unhappy. Fuck this habit of mine -- drinking! I told myself "Come on take control of your life, and quit your age-old habits!" </p>

This is where it all began. Deep within, I feel beautiful as I've decided to quit drinking. I still smell the aroma of success, and I feel fascinating. The day went as I'd planned. I did not drink. One habit changed. Heck, I even switched to a plain and simple diet - boil the veggies, top them with salt and pepper and relish! Success!</p>

I sense excitement and joyfulness. Boy oh boy, I'm 16 again!<br/>

Today, I started adding bits to my calendar to keep track of my hourly progress.<br/>

Tremendous stuff. I'm trying to be organized. I love the control!<br/>

The day went as I'd planned. Shortly after my breakfast, I rushed to coach a batch of young, and talented web developers. I went home by late evening and watched a few videos. Later in the evening, boiled a few stands of spinach, a potato, and three chilies topped them with a bit of salt, pepper and ate a simple, and healthy meal.</p>

Success! Day 3 and I remain committed to my schedule.

I woke up a little late today, thus skipped a breakfast and directly ate my lunch. Yummy spinach ground with other wholesome items. The classes went regularly and I felt livelier as a mentor today. At the evening, I tossed a cake of noodles with chopped onions, chillies, and ate them while I enjoyed my sweetcorn soup. Again for the dinner, I had fried ochre with a wheat bread plus two bananas. I did smoke 3 cigarettes. I eventually intend to reduce or quit smoking completely. I nearly forgot to state - I began reading a book.</p>

Success. Though, I had an urge grab a pint of beer. I ignored the feeling. At the moment, it's 08:30 PM, I might have a can of aerated drink or two a little later. I did read about two to three paragraphs from the book. The day was wonderful! After the coaching, I took a power nap for an hour. I sat blank for a few minutes in the late evening. Again, I had a healthy breakfast(Light rice) and lunch(boiled potatoes). Smoked a cigaret today: Progress. </p>
